                    <p>In the early 19th century, the Mughal empire which ruled India was in decline. India had split up
                        into many smaller
                        princely states. European countries (France, Portugal, Britain and Netherlands) had trading
                        companies in India. The British East India Company was the largest and most powerful. They took
                        control of many Indian
                        princely states and the Company ruled India from 1757 to 1857.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The East India Company</h4>
                    <p> The East India Company, was an English joint-stock company. The company received a Royal Charter
                        from
                        Queen Elizabeth I on 31 December 1600. It was formed to trade in the Indian Ocean region,
                        initially with Mughal India
                        and the East Indies, and later with Qing China. The Monopoly on trade made the Company very rich
                        and powerful.
                        The company ended up seizing control of large parts of the Indian subcontinent, colonised parts
                        of Southeast Asia,
                        and Hong Kong after a war with Qing China.

                <div class="card-body">
                    <p>There were political and social discontent with the rule of the East India Company. Lets look at
                        these causes.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Long term causes</h4>
                    <p>The Indian princely states resented the British domination of the Company. The Company used
                        underhand tactics to take
                        over Indian states . The doctrine of lapse prohibited a Hindu ruler without a natural heir from
                        adopting a successor and,
                        after the ruler died or abdicated, annexing his land.The old Indian aristocracy was being
                        replaced by British officials.
                        There was a growing fear and discontent amongst the aristocracy and the Brahmans, many of whom
                        had been dispossessed.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Mid term causes</h4>
                    <p>The mid term causes were the social and religious concerns in India and Britain.</p>
                    <p>A serious concern was the increasing pace of Westernization. Western ideas and methods of
                        education was a direct challenge
                        to orthodoxy, both Hindu and Muslim.

                        Missionaries were challenging the religious beliefs of the Hindus, Muslims and converting people
                        to Christianity.

                        The humanitarian reform efforts (toward emancipating women, remarriage of Hindu widows)
                        challenged Hindu beliefs.

                        These practices led to distrust of the Company and fueled the religious anger in the orthodoxy.
                    </p>
                    <p>Britons from varying social classes felt sympathy and admiration for their Indian counterparts,
                        even before 1857.

                        There was discontent about East India Company's treatment of Indians. There were calls in the
                        Parliament for free trade and including Indians in government.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The trigger</h4>
                    <p>The mutiny broke out in the Bengal army.

                        The trigger for revolt was the introduction of the new Enfield rifle. To load it, the Sepoy had
                        to bite off the ends of lubricated cartridges. A rumor spread among the Sepoy that the grease
                        used to lubricate the cartridges was a mixture of pigs’ and cows’ lard; thus, to have oral
                        contact with it was an insult to both Muslims and Hindus.

                        On April 24, in Meerut, 85 soldiers refused to use the cartridges and were court martialed and
                        severely punished.

                        The next day, the remaining sepoys rebelled triggering the mutiny.</p>

                    <p>Even before the mutiny, there was discontent in Britain about the EIC. The outrage and backlash
                        over the mutiny forced the British government to abolish the East India Company after the Indian
                        mutiny of 1857.
                        With the Government of India Act 1858, the British government assumed the task of directly
                        ruling India in the new British Raj.</p>
                    <h4>A new start - Government of India Act 1858</h4>
                    <p>The Indian Rebellion of 1857 forced the British Government to pass the Act. The Act was followed
                        a few months later by Queen Victoria's announcement that India was part of the British empire.

                        The Company ceased to exercise over these territories. India was to be governed in the Queen's
                        name.
                        The Crown was empowered to appoint a Governor-General and the Governors of the Presidencies.
                        An Indian Civil Service was to be created under the control of the Secretary of State.
                        The company was abolished. All the property and other assets of the East India Company were
                        transferred to the Crown.

                        The Act ushered in a new period of Indian history, bringing about the end of Company rule in
                        India. All Indians became part of the British kingdom.

                    <p>Was the Indian Mutiny of 1857 a revolution?</p>
                    <p>Webster; a fundamental change in political organization, especially the overthrow or renunciation
                        of one government or ruler and the substitution of another by the governed</p>
                    <p>There was a fundamental change in political organization.
                        From: Rule by East India Company and princely states,
                        To: Rule of British Government and the Queen.
                    </p>
                    <p> In the Indian mutiny of 1857 the rebellion was crushed by the Company. However, the public
                        outrage in Britain forced the parliament to abolish the Company. Thus in the end there was a
                        change in the political organization for India.</p>
                    <p>India became a part of the British empire ruled by the British queen. The new government was fair
